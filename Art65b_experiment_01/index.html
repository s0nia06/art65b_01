       <p>
           Most browser games in the early 2000s through the 2010s were flash games.

       <p>
           Some examples of popular flash games in the 2010s:

       <h2 class="funkysubhead">My Experience with Flash Games</h2>
       <p>
        <br>I don't have too many records of my Fantage or Club Penguin adventures, but I remember liking how 
        I could log onto Fantage with my friends and we could play minigames and in-game competitions. Looking
        back, it was definitely a "gacha" game where you had to pay to get the really cool outfits, and "winning"
        items was really rare. I remember really wanting to pay to play some of the games. overall though, it was
        really nice that the game was free. now you have to pay a lot for video games. i remember i stopped playing
        flash games when i got the PC version of Minecraft for my 9th birthday. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <br>i remember that Club Penguin used to be a real hot spot for pedos since the primary
        demographic of users was children. it was pretty common to hear my friends talk about
        their older friends on the server. the mods were definitely not doing their jobs.
